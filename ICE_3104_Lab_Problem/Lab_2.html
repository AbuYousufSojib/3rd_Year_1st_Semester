			<!-- <p>The image on the previous may have text positioned right next to its edges. It looks better to have some space around the image. To ask for (say) 10 pixels of horizontal space to surround the image use the img tag attribute hspace="10", and to ask for (say) 15 pixels of vertical space use vspace="15". There are 10 pixels of space between the right edge of the image and the start of the text and the right. And there are 15 pixels of space between the bottom edge of the image and the paragraph that follows it.</p> -->
